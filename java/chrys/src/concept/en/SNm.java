/**
 * Dynamic concept Names.
 * Some concept can have a name, that is known to code, some have not. You can think of them as dynamic concepts with static names.
 * Here are those names. They are some sort of a lightweight static concept, when we need it as only a marker, not a
 * container for data and methods. They can be used as a key to find a concept. Others can be found only by a cid.
